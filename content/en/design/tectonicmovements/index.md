From 18 November 2022 to 19 March 2023, the Muzeum Sztuki in Łódź hosted an exhibition entitled _Tectonic Movements: On the Artistic Symptoms of the Transition_. Curated by Jakub Banasiak, it featured over a hundred works of art created in Poland in the 1980s and 1990s. This was a period when the Polish People’s Republic was transforming into the Third Polish Republic. The exhibition followed a two-pronged approach: the first strand addressed economic and political issues—“the matter”—while the second focused on metaphysical questions and presented the diversity of spiritual attitudes during Poland’s period of transition.

In the visual identity, I used the Labil Grotesk typeface, whose slanted, unstable characters refer to the exhibition title, “Tectonic Movements,” as well as to the instability and ambiguity of the era.

The posters are based on the most iconic artworks shown in the exhibition: Mariola Przyjemska’s _Volcano_, Paweł Kwiek’s _Meals of the Poorest_, a still from Wilhelm Sasnal’s video _Emigrant_, and an untitled work by Piotr Uklański.

A key element of the design process was a 1:100 scale paper model, which served as the basis for preparing production wall layouts and floor plans. The physical mock-up allowed for effective testing of object placement within the rooms and provided an intuitive sense of scale. This solution proved helpful during working meetings and discussions with the curator.

The exposition required the construction of special display elements in the decorative Mirror Hall. I applied a raw plywood structure that contrasted with the ornamental walls. I placed two double-sided frames within it, which were used to display Egon Fietke’s graphic design printed on the reverse of an election poster and a two-sided painting by Karol Suka.

The colour scheme of the section devoted to spirituality featured dark shades of grey, yellow and earthy tones, while the political and economic topics were distinguished by white, red, and light gray.

Apart from works of art—paintings, drawings, sculptures, installations, and videos—archival materials and documents of social life were also presented. The processes and transformations of the transition period were analysed using diagrams and timelines. The infographic layer of the show allows complex interdependencies to be to presented visually.

Oprócz dzieł sztuki: obrazów, rysunków, rzeźb, instalacji i prac wideo, na wystawie zaprezentowane zostały również archiwalia i dokumenty życia społecznego. Procesy i przemiany okresu transformacji przeanalizowane zostały przy pomocy wykresów i osi czasu. Warstwa infograficzna ekspozycji pozwoliła na obrazowe przedstawienie złożonych zależności.
