The exhibition _This Road Was Endless: On Stanisław Staszewski_, dedicated to the architect, singer and artist known primarily as [Tata Kazika](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Kazika) [Kazik’s Father], was opened at the end of 2025 at the Adam Mickiewicz Museum of Literature in Warsaw. It was curated by three researchers of Staszewski’s life and work: Krzysztof Gajda, Maciej Kubiak, and Przemysław Lembicz. I supported them by developing the exhibition design, typography and two neon signs.

The display has been divided into two sections: Płock and Paris. The neon signs I designed refer to illuminated advertisements from the era and are associated with venues where Staszewski created and performed. He frequented Marabud while serving as the chief architect of Płock, and Le Ravaillac after emigrating to France.

The collection brings together documents, private photographs, personal belongings, correspondence, manuscripts, drawings and song recordings. These artifacts offer visitors a close look at Staszewski’s art and life.

The typography and color palette directly reflect the poems at the heart of the exhibition, where black and gold predominate. The gold characters set against black backgrounds use the Nocturne Serif typeface by Mateusz Machalski, featuring forms based on Roman stone-carved lettering.
