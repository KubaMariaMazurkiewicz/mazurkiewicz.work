The book, written by historian Błażej Brzostek and published by the Museum of Warsaw, serves as a guidebook that presents a concise history of Poland’s capital through selected objects from the Museum’s collection.

#### The graphic design of the book received the Must Have quality mark during the Łódź Design Festival.

Each chapter consists of a short text paired with an illustration based on an object from the Museum’s collection. I looked for distinctive features in these items and tried to bring them to life. The visual narrative that unfolds from page to page also plays an essential role in the project.
