The exhibition “Bleaching” concerns the colonial origins of part of the Etnographic Museum’s collection. The visual communication concept is based on two elements: a graphic, symbolic title and a minimalistic typographic frame containing additional information. I created the poster and a graphic design for the exhibition.

The promotional campaign took place on the streets of Warsaw and online. The typography in the exhibition was printed directly onto the walls using a mobile printer.

The exhibition and display case design was developed by Bartek Buczek. The color palette for the project included black, white, and natural wood tones.
