The exhibition of ceramics from the collections of the State Ethnographic Museum in Warsaw emphasizes the physicality of the process of creating clay vessels. The objects presented at the exhibition play a key role in a series of posters advertising the event. Using basic visual tools—framing, multiplication, and rythym—I composed micro-scenes and interpreted the stories contained within the objects.

I based the visual identity on a color palette that includes several earthy, clay shades and a complementary purple. Thanks to this, the colors of objects do not clash with the background and you can always choose the right background contrast.

The exhibition is permanent, but the artifacts will be changed and updated regularly. The visual identity aligns with this concept—new posters may appear as the objects are updated.
