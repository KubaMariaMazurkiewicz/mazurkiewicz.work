I was born in 1988 and grew up in Dąbrowice, Poland. I am a designer, artist, and lecturer. I live and work in Mazovia.

My first conscious project was a hand-drawn edition of _Gazeta Teatralna_ [Theatre Newspaper], published in two copies. I was just a few years old at the time, and together with my siblings I ran the Teatr Szopka [Shead Theatre] in our garden. In high school, I published the monthly _Prusak_ with my friends, I was its editor and designer, and I also published my comics there. During my studies, I organized the Turbo gallery, the gablotakrytyki.pl blog collective, and the self-proclaimed Mental Structures Studio. Later, I was a member of the interdisciplinary design studio zespół wespół [Team Together] for almost ten years.

In 2012, I graduated from the Faculty of Graphic Arts at the Academy of Fine Arts in Warsaw. In 2022, I defended my doctoral thesis on the future of funeral rituals. For over a decade, I have been working at my alma mater in the Faculty of Artistic Research and Curatorial Studies. I teach classes in graphic design, alternative design, local history, and perceptiveness.

As a designer, I work with publishers, galleries, museums, and non-governmental organizations. I specialize in book design, visual identity, and exhibition displays. My projects have been awarded and recognized the following competitions: Good Design, Most Beautiful Polish Books, Must Have, and Project of the Year. I have been running my own studio since 2021. In the [design]({{< relref "design" >}}) section, you will find a selection of my work from recent years.

Artistic activity is an important part of my practice. I am interested in everyday life, rituals, infrastructure, local history, and critical cartography. I use various medias: drawing, video, photography. I regularly create zines, most recently: [_W–E: Life Between the West and the East_]({{< relref "art/we" >}}) (2025). I value collaboration, which is why I often work on exhibitions and art publications as part of collectives. My work can be viewed in the section dedicated to [art]({{< relref "art" >}}).
